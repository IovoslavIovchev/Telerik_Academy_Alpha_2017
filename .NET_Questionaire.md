## C# Language

### Questions that you must be able to answer in detail

* #### What is C#? </br>
    C# is a simple, strongly typed, object-oriented,  C-like language, designed and developed by Microsoft.

* #### What is the name of the C# compiler? </br>
    CSC is the .NET Framework compiler. You can use it to compile from the command line. E.g.:
    ```
    csc Program.cs
    ```
    </br>
    For .NET Core you can compile through the CLI:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

* #### Why to use ``using`` in C#? </br>
    - The `using` directive can be used to:
        - Reference a namespace. E.g.:

        ```csharp
        // Consider this
        using System;

        public class Program
        {
            public static void Main()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
            }
        }

        // Rather than this
        public class Program
        {
            public static void Main()
            {
                System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
            }
        }
        ```

        - Create an `Alias` for a namespace/type. E.g.:
        ```csharp
        using GenericCollections = System.Collections.Generic
        ```

    - When working with unmanaged resources (a.k.a. resourses that are not under the control of the `Garbage Collector`) and types that implement the `IDisposable` interface, we want to ensure that there are no leftovers after we have finished using them and that the `Dispose()` method has been called. E.g.:
    ```csharp
    using (var stream = new Stream())
    {
        // use the stream
    } // the Dispose() method is called
    ```

* #### What is the difference between ``constant`` and ``readonly`` variables in C#? </br>
    A ``constant`` variable can only be assigned a value once, while a ``readonly`` variable can be assigned multiple values but only in the class's constructor or at compile-time. E.g.:
    ```csharp
    public class SomeClass
    {
        private readonly int x;

        private const int y = 5; // initialized at compile-time

        public SomeClass()
        {
            this.x = 5; // x = 5
            y = 3; // "The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable, property or indexer"

            this.x = 10; // x = 10
        }

        public void ChangeReadonly()
        {
            this.x = 3; // "A readonly field cannot be assigned to (except in a constructor or a variable initializer)"
        }
    }
    ```

* #### What are the two different types of errors in C#? </br>
    ``Compile-time`` errors are syntax errors, and won't let your code get compiled. E.g.:
    ```csharp
    public static void Main()
    {
        int[] array = new int[5];
        array[-8] = 420; // "Indexing an array with a negative index"
    }
    ```

    ``Run-time`` errors are logical errors that have correct syntax but thow an exception while the code is executing. E.g.:
    ```csharp
    public static void Main()
    {
        int[] array = new int[5];
        array[8] = 420; // Index out of range exception
    }
    ```

* #### What is the difference between ``out`` and ``ref`` parameters in C#? 
    Both `out` and `ref` are used to pass an argument by `reference`, rather than `value`.
    The difference is that an argument *must* be initialized before passing it with `ref`
    ```csharp
    public static void Main()
    {
        int number;

        AddOneWithRef(ref number); // Use of unassigned variable 'number'
        Console.WriteLine(number);

        AddOneWithOut(out number);
        Console.WriteLine(number);
    }

    private static void AddOneWithOut(out int number)
    {
        number = 1;
        number++;
    }

    private static void AddOneWithRef(ref int number)
    {
        number++;
    }
    ```

* #### What is the difference between “as” and “is” operators in C#?
    - `as` can be used to convert between compatible types or nullable types
    - `is` can be used to evaluate the compatibility between certain types.
    
    Consider the following:
    ```csharp
    public class Main
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            var doge = new Dog();
            if (doge is Animal)
            {
                Animal dog = doge as Animal;
                dog.MakeSound(); // outputs "Animal Sound"
            }
        }
    }

    class Animal
    {
        public void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Animal Sound");
        }
    }

    class Dog : Animal
    {
        public new void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Dog Sound");
        }
    }
    ```
* #### What you mean by delegate in C#?
    A delegate is a type that has the same signature and return type as other methods and can be used as a `pointer` to them.
* #### What are the types of delegates in C#?
    - `Single Delegate`. It points to a single method and can invoke only it.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
    - `Multicast Delegate`. It can point to multiple methods, as long as they have the same *signature* and *return type*. The methods are invoked in the sequence they were added.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
    - `Generic Delegate`. Unlike Single & Multicast Delegates, `Generic Delegates` do *not* require an instance in order to be invoked.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
* #### What are the three types of Generic delegates in C#?
    There are three types of Generic Delegates:
    - `Action` defines a method that is of type `void`.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
    - `Func` defines a method that returns a value, which can be any valid C# type.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
    - `Predicate` defines a method that takes parameter, and, based on them, determines whether an object meets a certain criteria. In short, it returns a `Boolean`.
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
* #### Why to use Null Coalescing Operator in C#?
    You can use the Null Coalescing Operator to assign a default value to a `Nullable` or a `Reference` type. E.g:
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
</br>

### *Questions you should have general knowledge of and should answer in a few words:*

* #### Why to use lock statement in C#?

## C# Object Oriented Programming

### *Questions that you must be able to answer in detail:*

* #### What is a class ?
    A `class` is a `custom type` with an abundance of grouped variables, methods & events. In short, a class serves as a blueprint that defines the data and functionality of a type.
* #### What is an Object?
    An `object` is an instance of a `non-static` class. E.g:
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
* #### What is Reference Type in C# ?
    A reference type is a type that can be accessed by its address(reference) in the memory. Two variables can hold the reference to the same object
    ```csharp
    //write here
    ```
* #### What are the Access Modifiers in C# ?
    - The `public` modifier means that there is no restriction on accessibility. The member can be accessed from *anywhere*.
    - The `private` modifier limits the member to being accessible only to the containing type.
    - The `protected` modifier limits the member to being available only to the containing class and classes that inherit it.
    - The `internal` modifier limits the member to being accessible *only* from the current assembly.
    - The `protected internal` modifier limits the member to being available to the containing class or classes that inherit it withing the `current` assembly.

* #### What you mean by boxing and unboxing in C#?
* #### Explain Partial Class in C#?
    The keyword `partial` allows one class to be split accross multiple `.cs` files in the *same* assembly and namespace. Later on all the files are combined into one class by the `compiler`.
* #### Explain Static constructor in C#?
    A static constructor is called `only once` automatically before the first instance of the class is created. It *cannot* be called directly and does not take any parameters or modifiers.
* #### Explain Indexers in C#?
    Indexers allow a *class* or *struct* to be used as an array to encapsulate a collection/array.
* #### Explain Attributes in C#?
    An attribute is a `tag` that provides metadata and information to the runtime about the behaviour of namespaces, classes, structures, methods, properties, etc.
* #### Explain Overloading in C# ?
    Overloading in C# allows a multiple methods with the same name to be declared, as long as their return type and signature are different.
* #### What is Data Encapsulation ?
    `Data Encapsulation` allows for hiding properties, fields or methods that will not be needed outside the specified class, therefore enabling protection of the data.
* #### Explain Inheritance in C# ?
    When you declare a derived (child) class it can reuse, extend and modify the behaviour of its base (parent) class. The derived class can access any `public` or `protected` fields, properties and methods, and `private` only if it is `nested` inside the base class.
* #### Can Multiple Inheritance implemented in C# ?
    In C# a class can inherit *only one* class. E.g. if class `A` inherits class `B`, it cannot inherit class `C` as well.
* #### What is Polymorphism in C# ?
    Polymorphism is the ability of objects to be treated as objects of their `base` type and to provide different implementations of the same method. E.g. a base class can have a `virtual` method that its heirs can `override`.
* #### Explain the use of Virtual Keyword in C# ?
    The keyword `virtual` allows a property or method of the base class to be `overriden` in a derived class. 
* #### What is Method Hiding in C# ?
    When a `derived` class has a *method* with the same name as a method from its `base` class it `hides` that base method.
* #### What are Sealed Classes in C# ?
    Sealed Classes are classes that cannot be inherited.
